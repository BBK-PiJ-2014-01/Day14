Day14

Exercise 1:
- Classes Fibonacci & TestFibonacci(parameterized) completed
- The method with memoization takes far less time to perform the calculation
    For n=40:   without memoization: about 450ms
                with memoization: less than 1ms.
    For n=45:   without memoization: about 4500ms
                with memoization: about 2ms.

Exercise 2:
- Classes Anagram & LaunchAnagram completed
- Recursive approach adopted
- Iterative approach seems far more complicated

Exercise 3:
- Classes Hailstone & LaunchHailstone completed
- Numbers always seem to converge to 1 (ends-up repeating the sequence 4,2,1)

Exercise 4:
- Classes Binary and LaunchBinary completed
- In lists of 10, 100 or 1000, we need about 5 comparisons to find an element

Exercise 5:
- Class Sort with static method mergeSort() implemented
- Class LaunchSort implemented. Printing a list before and after a Mergesort.

Exercise 6:
- Static method quickSort() implemented in Class Sort.
- Running a Quicksort from LaunchSort Class. Printing a list before and after the Quicksort.
